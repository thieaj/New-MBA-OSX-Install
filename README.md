# New MBA OSX Install

I have a MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018). It's lightweight, great on battery life, and runs the latest OS X version without issues, *mostly*.

Everyone is going to say, "You never *need* to reinstall OS X." For the most part that's true. I didn't *need* to. However, I <wanted> to. There's really nothing better to get you on track then a fresh install, a clean slate. 

## The Problem(s)
I am very indecisive about what I think the best software I should be using is, how to organize it and how to get there. This repo is more for me to remember all the steps I need to take to get to a functioning MacBook Air, but anyone can use it. 

Consider this, *my* Pre-Flight Checklist.

## Backups
Backup. Backup. Backup. Then backup again for good measure. In fact, stop reading and go back up now. If you can't say immediatly when your last backup was, it has been to long. 

In fact, I'm going to run a backup now, before I do anything else.

I leverage a two-fold backup method.
1. TimeMachine: TimeMachine is my _local_ backup method. A spare 2 TB external harddrive has been repurposed to si on my desk. I plug it in once a week, usually on Fridays, and force a backup every "week", or when I remember to do it.
2. [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/02w46x)*
