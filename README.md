# New MBA OSX Install

I have a MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018). It's lightweight, great on battery life, and runs the latest OS X version without issues, mostly.

Everyone is going to say, "You never *need* to reinstall OS X. For the most part thats true. I didn't *need* to. However, I <wanted> to. There's really nothing better to get you on track then a fresh install, a clean slate. 

## The Problem(s)
I am very indecisive about what I think the best software I should be using is, and how to orgaznie it and how to get there. This repo is more for me to remeber all of the steps I need to take to get to a functioning MacBook Air, but anyone can use it. 

Consider this, *my* Pre-Flight Checklist.

### Backups
Backup. Backup. Backup. Then backup again for good measure. In fact, stop reading and go back up now. If you cant say immediatly when your last backup was, it has been to long. 

In fact, I'm going to backup now, before I do anything else.
